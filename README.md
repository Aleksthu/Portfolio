# Portfolio made with React

This is my personal portfolio, built from the ground up using create-react-app.

The site displays most of the projects I have worked on. Most of the projects have been made following Udemy tutorials, this portfolio is the only one I have made from the beginning without help.


// The commit history is a bit of a mess, as most of the commits was made when uploading to Heroku.
